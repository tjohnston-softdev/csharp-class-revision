# C# Class Revision

This is a repository for study notes I have written while revising classes and object-orienated programming in C#. These notes are based on the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_oop.php) tutorial. I did this revision in order to help transition from JavaScript (Node JS) back to C#, which was my main language prior to learning Node.

## Foreword

Whenever the topic comes up in technical discussion, I always point out that C# and JavaScript are quite similar. If you can understand one, you can learn the other without too much trouble. That said, each language has its own set of quirks that you have to be wary of. I won't try to describe them in detail here but there are times where I have by accident tried to write C# code in Node JS...or vice-versa.

Normally, I can alternate between C# and JavaScript quite well but during a recent co-pairing exercise related to some C# code I wrote, I was left pretty embarrassed over how out of practice I am with C#'s subtle details, such as whether a variable is a [reference type or a value type](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-value-type-and-reference-type). Looking at it from a JS perspective became second nature but when it came to C#, I had completely forgotten. That said, the fundamentals would be similar in JS but it had been years since I actually had to discuss C# theory instead of just *writing* it. To be fair, I suppose anybody could get that wrong and quickly Google it just to be sure. The real problem was that I had forgotten most of what I knew about classes and objects, so I decided to put my energy into revising that and hope it works out in the long run.

This repository is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal. These study notes are based on the [C# language tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_oop.php) from W3Schools. Therefore, I cannot claim any personal copyright over the contents. I simply converted the notes to markdown and made them available here for archiving purposes.

I wrote these notes for myself as part of my own self-learning and, as such, may not be useful for everybody. Since all of the notes are derived from the W3Schools tutorial, it was unnecessary to cite individual pages. The basic structure and content is similar enough that cross-referencing shouldn't be difficult.

As mentioned, I wrote these notes for myself and are by no means perfect. I will not be actively maintaining this repository but I will consider revising things if I feel the overwhelming need to do so. Since this is licensed under CC0 and I claim no copyright, you may do whatever you want with it.
